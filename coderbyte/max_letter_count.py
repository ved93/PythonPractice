#  Using the Python language, have the function LetterCountI(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the
# first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return
# greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with
# repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.
