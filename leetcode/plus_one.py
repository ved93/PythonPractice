# Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, increment one to the integer.

# The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit.

# You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

# Example 1:

# Input: [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,4]
# Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.






class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(digits)
        
        # move along the input array starting from the end
        for i in range(n):
            idx = n - 1 - i
            # set all the nines at the end of array to zeros
            if digits[idx] == 9:
                digits[idx] = 0
            # here we have the rightmost not-nine
            else:
                # increase this rightmost not-nine by 1 
                digits[idx] += 1
                # and the job is done
                return digits
                
        # we're here because all the digits are nines
        return [1] + digits
