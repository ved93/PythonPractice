Binary tree traversal methods
1. Preorder traversal
2. In order of traversal
3. Level order

Construct Binary Tree from an array. here array is in level order format 
Print array from the tree

* if index(parent) = N, index(left child) = 2*N+1
* if index(parent) = N, index(right child) = 2*N+2
* if index(child) = N, index(parent) = (N-1)/2 (integer division with truncation)
